# Euclidean Rhythm Pattern Generator

This tool creates [Euclidean rhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_rhythm) patterns based on three parameters: _steps_, _beats_, and _offset_. The Euclidean algorithm distributes a chosen number of beats as evenly as possible across a fixed number of steps, producing many well-known rhythmic structures found in world music.

Use the steps slider to set the total length of the pattern, and the beats slider to choose how many pulses it contains. The generated pattern is displayed as a row of rectangles—colored ones represent beats. The offset slider rotates the pattern without recalculating it, letting you shift the rhythm forward or backward.

This tool is only a pattern generator: it doesn’t play sounds or send MIDI. You can use the visual output to program rhythms into your hardware or software sequencers.
